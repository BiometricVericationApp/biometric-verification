\subsubsection{ESP-01}
The ESP-01 module is programmed to receive the biometric data from the Arduino NANO-BLE33 and publish it to an MQTT broker. The implementation covers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Establishing a WiFi connection.
    \item Setting up MQTT client and handling reconnections.
    \item Reading data from the Arduino via Serial communication.
    \item Publishing the received data to the MQTT broker under the topic "sensor3/data".
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Challenges and Solutions}
During the integration of the biometric sensors with the Arduino and ESP-01, several challenges were encountered and subsequently addressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Serial Communication:} The initial challenge was to establish a stable and reliable serial communication between the Arduino NANO-BLE33 and the ESP-01. This was achieved by setting a consistent baud rate and implementing a protocol to ensure complete data packets were sent and received.
\item \textbf{MQTT Connectivity:} Maintaining a stable MQTT connection, especially handling reconnections and network instability, was critical. This was addressed by implementing a reconnection strategy in the ESP-01â€™s software.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dedication Time}
Approximately 30 hours were dedicated to developing the user data collection system, using most of the time on playing with malfunctioning or hard to use sensors.

\subsubsection{MQTT Topics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{sensor3/heart:} This is the topic used to publish heart rate biometric data.
    \item \textbf{sensor3/galvanic:} Used to publish galvanic resistance data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
The integration of the Arduino NANO-BLE33 with the ESP-01 for biometric data collection and transmission via MQTT represents a significant advancement in the biometric verification system. This setup not only provides real-time data monitoring but also enhances the system's capability to make a prediction on the user's identity.
